# Generate TypeScript Declaration Files

- For creating and using TypeScript declaration files.
- Use DefinitelyTyped instead where you can, if there is an issue there, consider adding here.

## Usage

To use any declaration file built here, do the following:

1: Install this library.

```bash
npm i -D @theopenweb/schema --ignore-scripts
```

2: Create/update your tsconfig.json file.

- Replace [PACKAGE_NAME] with the package name used.
- The first path is for handling of default export.
- The second path is for handling of nested paths.
- "baseUrl" is relative to the tsconfig.json which affects the paths, if the baseUrl must be something different, the paths must also be changed appropriately.
- Depending on build, there may be slight discrepencies. Check the generated types file hierarchy if any issues arise.

```json
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "baseUrl": "./",
        "paths": {
            "[PACKAGE_NAME]": ["node_modules/@theopenweb/schema/schema/generated/declarations/[PACKAGE_NAME]/index.d.ts"],
            "[PACKAGE_NAME]/*": ["node_modules/@theopenweb/schema/schema/generated/declarations/[PACKAGE_NAME]/*"]
        }
    }
}
```

## Build

```bash
# From this directory
npm run build
```

## Addition

- In this directory do: `npm i [PACKAGE_NAME] --ignore-scripts`
- Create a pull request.
- DONE.

## Specification

- For each specified JS project(Installed as npm module for now), build tsc declaration files in generated area.
- Do NOT output any files other than types, especially code, licenses and other info, OK.
- Packages to make types for could increase a lot over time, so do NOT install into main project, SHOULD have separate area for install.
- Generating the same types again could become a large waste of time. Prevent by this by checking if types have already been generated by npm package.json version. Store the state of generated type versions.
